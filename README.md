Deployment method:
can be deployed anywhere any server which supports the HTML, CSS, JS. 
for github deployment, create repo and give the name or rename to something like this. 

username.github.io

replace the username with your actual username.

also goto repo settings and provide the `/out` directory as the build directory so that part gets deployed not the nextjs source code.
